# TODO: Set the player's starting room for the simplified prototype.

# TODO: Create the gameplay loop required by the milestone.
# Within the loop, complete the required behavior in small steps:
#   1. Display the current room.
#   2. Prompt for a movement command or "exit".
#   3. Branch for a valid move, exit, or invalid input.
#   4. Update the room only after a valid movement command.
#   5. Continue until the required exit condition is reached.

# TODO: Run and debug all milestone cases in prototype/README.md.
